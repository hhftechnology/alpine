## üèîÔ∏è What is Alpine Linux?

Alpine Linux is a Linux distribution built around musl libc and BusyBox. The image is only 5 MB in size and has access to a package repository that is much more complete than other BusyBox based images. This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities and even production applications.

## ‚ú® Features

* Minimal size only, minimal layers
* Memory usage is minimal on a simple install
* [s6 overlay](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) enabled for PID 1 init capabilities
* [zabbix-agent](https://zabbix.org) (Classic and Modern) for individual container monitoring
* Scheduling via cron with other helpful tools (bash, curl, less, logrotate, nano, vi) for easier management
* Messaging ability via MSMTP enabled to send mail from container to external SMTP server
* Firewall included with capabilities of monitoring logs to block remote hosts via [Fail2ban](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban)
* Logshipping capabilities to remote log analysis servers via [Fluent-Bit](https://github.com/fluent/fluent-bit)
* Ability to update User ID and Group ID permissions dynamically

## Prerequisites and Assumptions

No prerequisites required

## Installation

### Build from Source
Clone this repository and build the image with `docker build <arguments> (imagename) .`

### Prebuilt Images
Builds of the image are available on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/hhftechnology/alpine)

```bash
docker pull docker.io/hhftechnology/alpine:(imagetag)
```

Builds of the image are also available on the [Github Container Registry](https://github.com/hhftechnology/alpine/pkgs/container/alpine)

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/hhftechnology/alpine:(imagetag)
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architectures

* ```:amd64```, ```:x86_64``` - 64 bit Intel/AMD (x86_64/amd64)
* ```:arm64v8```, ```:aarch64``` - 64 bit ARM (ARMv8/aarch64)
* ```:arm32v7```, ```:armhf``` - 32 bit ARM (ARMv7/armhf)

Images are built primarily for `amd64` architecture, and may also include builds for `arm/v7`, `arm64` and others. These variants are all unsupported. Consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/hhftechnology) my work so that I can work with various hardware.

## üöÄ How to use this image

Utilize this image as a base for further builds. Please visit the [s6 overlay repository](https://github.com/just-containers/s6-overlay) for instructions on how to enable the S6 init system when using this base or look at some of my other images which use this as a base.
